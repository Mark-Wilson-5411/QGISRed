about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a free QGIS plugin developed to make easier the task of building hydraulic models of water distribution networks. The plugin takes full advantage of working under a GIS environment for georeferencing all network elements, use geographic backgrounds, editing the graphical and alphanumerical data, using geoprocessing tools, visualizing data by layers, customizing the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed has powerful tools to detect any kind of errors the user may make when editing information with QGIS tools before launching the model simulation.</p><p>Furthermore, QGISRed incorporates numerous tools to make it easier for the user to build the model and analyse the results without having to use QGIS's own tools. The most highlighted tools are: </p><li>Scenario manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Creating a new empty Scenario automatically</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files and external shapefiles</li><li>Automatic creation of topological relations between elements, freeing the user from it</li><li>Tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default property assignment when creating new elements</li><li>Automatic interpolation of nodes elevation</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness</li><li>Verification of the integrity of all declared properties and options</li><li>Declaration and handling of auxiliary elements such as isolation valves, service connections, hydrants, purge valves, flowmeters, sensors, etc.</li><li>Optional integration of some of the auxiliary elements to be part of the model</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic and demand sectors</li><li>Connection to EPANET toolkit for carrying out simulations</li><li>Simulation and visualization of the results in tables, color maps and numeric labels</li><li>Automatic declaration of legends and symbology, revisable from QGIS</li><li>Browsing results over time</li><p>To improve processing time, QGISRed uses binary libraries developed in .net, which configure the core of the GISRed application.</p><p>For more information the plugin manual, both in <a href="https://redhisp.webs.upv.es/files/QGISRed/manuals/QGISRed_0.7_usermanual_en.pdf">English</a> and <a href="https://redhisp.webs.upv.es/files/QGISRed/manuals/QGISRed_0.7_usermanual_es.pdf">Spanish</a>, can be consulted.</p><p><b>Requeriments</b>  .Net Framework 4.5 - Windows OS.</p><p><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top"><input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" /><input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="25M4ZMR52H8ZN" /><input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/ES/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_ES/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" /></form></p>
